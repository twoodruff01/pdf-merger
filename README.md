A simple web-site written using Python and Flask.

It merges PDFs that users upload, and allows them to download the merged document.
Obviously I didn't write the PDF merging logic...

A much easier introduction to web-development than when I tried learning React last year lol.

Development:
    export FLASK_APP=app
    export FLASK_ENV=development
    flask run
